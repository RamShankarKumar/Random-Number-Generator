# What did I learn from this project ?

1. Store user number input field in a JavaScript variable.
2. About Math.random() madule in JavaScript.
3. Get Value of input element before user hits the submit button. Has not used this concept into this project but learnt because of this project. I will try to include one project with this concept too.
